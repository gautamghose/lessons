1. Used get_snp500.py to retrieve a list of S&P500 company tickers, and their categories.
        $.> get_snp500.py > sp500.txt

2. Used get_historical.py to retrieve all historical quotes for all S&P500 tickers.
    This script takes a 'tickers.lst' file and all ticker symbols it finds, it retrieves
    their historical quotes from google-financial. The sp500.txt file produced in (1)
    above could be copied into tickers.lst and get_historical.py will work on it.
    For each ticker in ticker.lst file, the get_historical.py script will produce
    a <ticker-symbol>.csv file in the current directory.
    So after get_historical.py is run, the current directory will have about 500 *.csv
    files.
        $./raw_data> ../get_historical.py

3. Used count_events.py to identify all the significant "events" in each of the csv
    file.
        #Usage: <script-name> <percent-move> <list of TICKER.csv filenames>
        $./raw_data> ../count_events.py 7.0 *.csv > ../events/7pct_events

4. Used identify_market_events.py to parse the 7pct_events file produced at (3) to
    produce a file that would carry all the event dates that are deemed "market event".
    A "market event" is when multiple (in our example, 3) tickers moved by a significant
    percentage; i.e. 3 or more tickers had events on the same date.
        #Usage: <script-name> <filename-with-eventdates-foreach-ticker>
        $./events> ../identify_market_events.py  7pct_events > 7pct_market_events

5. Used identify_ticker_events.py to parse the original 7pct_events file, produced at (3)
    and the 7pct_market_events file produced at (4), find the non-overlaps and hence
    identify the ticker-specific events.
        #Usage: <script-name> <filename-with-eventdates-foreach-ticker> <filename-with-market-eventdates>
        $./events> ../identify_ticker_events.py 7pct_events 7pct_market_events > 7pct_ticker_events

6. Used ../generate_feature_data.py to read the 7pct_ticker_events file, produced at (5)
    and for each such event it consults the corresponding csv file for the ticker and
    prints out the percentage movement of that ticker for the previous 15 days. 
        #Usage: <script-name> <filename-with-all-identified-ticker-events> <directory-of-raw-csvfiles> <number-of-prior-days>
        $./feature_data> ../generate_feature_data.py ../events/7pct_ticker_events  ../raw_data  15 > featured_events.csv
